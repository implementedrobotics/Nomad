# NOMAD BLDC

NOMAD BLDC is a Compact High Bandwidth, High Performance Motor Control For Use in Robotics.

  - Designed for the STM32G474 microcontroller and the Texas Instruments DRV8323 Gate Driver.
  - Uses Field Oriented Control methods to achieve high efficiency/torque.
  - Integrated Absolute Encoder (AMS AS5147) provides rotor position for commutation as well as output shaft position.
  - CAN BUS Interface for sending actuator commands and reading back actuator state to be used by an external robot controller.
  - 40VDC 30A Continuous/80A Peak Current.

This work is originally based on the great work from Ben Katz.  Much of the hardware documentation and control ideas(as well as many other really cool projects) are documented at:
